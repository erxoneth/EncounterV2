# EncounterV2
A continuity app for keeping track of time, days spent in game, and future events. This app also includes a section for DM notes and a dice roller for your convenience.

This application is a general continuity tracker for tabletop RPGs. For more information on how the butttons work, press the "?" icon in the bottom right for a detailed description of how the interface works. This upload contains the latest stable update where all obvious bugs have been worked out and the program now prompts the user if they'd like to save before closing (big oops to those who tried it before). Game states are saved as a .txt file at a location of the user's choosing and may be loaded in the future. Save data is not read-only and modifying the text file will yield unexpected results; best to let it be.  The current version is available as a folder (currently 1.2), this contains a compiled 
executable which may be run on windows machines (no other platforms supported at this time)
